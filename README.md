## 🤖 Understanding Face Recognition
Face recognition technology uses mathematical algorithms that convert images into numerical data called "embeddings." These embeddings represent unique facial features, allowing accurate identification. This technology is useful for security apps, identity verification, and more.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting Common Issues
- **The application won't open.** 
  - Ensure your operating system meets the requirements.
  - Restart your device and try again.
  
- **I can't upload images.**
  - Check the file size and format. Use images in JPG or PNG format, under the size limit specified in the application.

- **Recognition fails.**
  - Ensure the face in the uploaded image is clear and well-lit. Images with shadows or obstructions may not work well.
